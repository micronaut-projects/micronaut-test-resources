This module adds a https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-control-panel/[Micronaut Control Panel] to the test resources server.

When added, the control panel module will be available on `/control-panel` of the test resources service.
For example, at startup, you will see the following message:

> Test Resources control panel can be browsed at http://localhost:40701/control-panel

This URL can only be accessed from the local host.
It provides information about:

- the Docker environment (status and containers which have been started)
- the test resources modules which are loaded in the test resources service (one for each test resource)
- the properties which have been resolved by each test resources provider

For example, it is possible to determine the database URL, username and password which were resolved by browsing to the corresponding test resources panel:

Note that the control panel _cannot_ show properties before the application has tried to resolve them, because the value of the properties depends on the request context.
That request context is displayed
