Micronaut Test Resources supports a subset of https://localstack.cloud/[Localstack] via https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/localstack/[Testcontainers].

The default image can be overwritten by setting the `test-resources.containers.localstack.image-name` property.

The following services are supported:

- S3, by providing the `aws.services.s3.endpoint-override` property
- DynamoDB, by providing the `aws.services.dynamodb.endpoint-override` property
- SQS, by providing the `aws.services.sqs.endpoint-override` property
- SNS, by providing the `aws.services.sns.endpoint-override` property

In addition, the following properties will be resolved by test resources:

- `aws.access-key-id`
- `aws.secret-key`
- `aws.region`
